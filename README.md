# sort_binary_array_O-n

Java program to sort a given binary array(array will only consist 0's and 1's) in linear times.
Linear time: An algorithm is said to take linear time, or O(n) time, if its time complexity is O(n). 
Example:
Input :
b_nums[] = { 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0 }
Output:
After sorting: [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
